As soon as possible, stay away from\nWindows. Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nOn Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.\n\nOn Windows, several options can be considered.\n\n+ Cygwin (with X): <https://x.cygwin.com>\n+ Git Bash: <https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash>\n\nTo jump start, here is a tutorial:\n[Ubunto Linux for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners).\n\nAt least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across\ndirectories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful.\n\n\n\n### Python\n\nSet up Python on your computer:\n\n- Python 3.\n- Python package manager __miniconda__ or __pip__.\n- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)\n\nI will be using IPython and Jupyter Notebook in class.\n\nReadability is important!\nCheck your Python coding styles against the recommended styles:\n<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>. A good place to start is the Section on\n\"Code Lay-out\". \n\n\nOnline books on Python for data science:\n\n+  [“Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data,” First Edition](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), by Jake VanderPlas, O’Reilly Media, 2016. \n2. [“Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pan- das, NumPy, and IPython.” Third Edition](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), by Wes McK- inney, O’Reilly Media, 2022. \n\n## Data Challenges\n\n+ [ASA Data Challenge Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home)\n+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)\n+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org)\n+ [Top 10 Data Science Competitions in\n  2023](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/data-science-competitions)\n  \n## Wishlist\n\nThis is a wish list from all members of the class (alphabetical\norder).
