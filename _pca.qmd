## Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) originated as a dimensionality reduction
algorithm which transforms a large set of variables into a smaller one that
still contains most of the information in the large set. It can also be useful
as a tool for visualization, for noise filtering, for feature extraction and
engineering, and much more.


### Introduction
PCA can be thought of as fitting an ellipsoid to the data, where each axis of
the ellipsoid represents a principal component. If some axis of the ellipsoid is
small, then the variance along that axis is also small. More formally, PCA is
defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new
coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of
the data comes to lie on the first coordinate, called the first principal
component (PC), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.
