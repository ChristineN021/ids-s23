In this chapter, a progression of graphs will be shown to demonstrate some of the capabilities the library has to graph and plot data."

To install, use either pip or Anaconda.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(8465);\n\nx = np.random.uniform(0,3,10);\ny = np.random.uniform(0,3,10);\nz = np.random.uniform(0,3,10);\n\nplt.scatter(x,y)\nplt.xlabel('X')\nplt.ylabel('Y')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe could start plotting another plot, but we have not saved our scatterplot as an object. Thus, it will get overridden by whatever we plot next. If we want to keep a plot, we can save as a subplot shown as follows."
