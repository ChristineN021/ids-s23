# Introduction to matplotlib


## Introduction

The matplotlib library can provide methods in plotting and arranging data visually in order to help viewers understand the main concepts of the data analysis.
In this chapter, a progression of graphs will be shown to demonstrate some of the capabilities the library has to graph and plot data.

## How to Use

The library is not part of the defaults used in Python. To install, use either pip or Anaconda.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(8465);

x = np.random.uniform(0,3,10);
y = np.random.uniform(0,3,10);
z = np.random.uniform(0,3,10);

plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.show()

```

Customization of plots can be done through different functions. For instance:

```{python}
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.show()
```

## Animation

Animations can also be done through matplotlib. This requires the use of the animation submodule which has a variety functions that can be used to plot animations.
Inputs required include the frames and other functions needed to update the plots per frame.
